    \frametitle{}
        Motivation, low power, etc

        IoT: Many small devices, lot of data, low compute power, high computation complexity.

        Solution: Compute offloading, communicate data to robust server to process.

        Problem: data privacy. In many cases this data is sensitive (like helth care data)


        Solution: HE or FHE.

\frametitle{What is HE?}

    Homomorphic Encryption (HE) $\rightarrow$ form of encryption. Early 80s
\vspace{-0.3cm}

    Operate \textbf{directly} with encrypted data (without the need of decrypt).
\vspace{-0.3cm}

    HE supports only addition, multiplication and rotation $\rightarrow$ only \textbf{linear} operations.
\vspace{0.3cm}
  \begin{columns}
    \column{0.5\textwidth}
Typical use case:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Client encrypted his data with his own secret key.
    \item Send this and the public key to the server.
    \item Server operates with out decryption (e.g. Machine Learning).
    \item Server send back the result in the encryption form.
    \item Client decrypts the result with the secret key.
\end{itemize}

    \frametitle{FHE}
  \begin{columns}
    \column{0.5\textwidth}
      In general, HE schemes use \texttt{Ring Learning With Errors} (RLWE) that
      adds some noise (error) to the encryption.

\vspace{0.3cm}
    This noise grows in each operation (particularly with multiplications).

\vspace{0.3cm}
      If the noise is too big will be undecryptable.

\end{columns}

    Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE): Unlimited number of operations. In this type of schemes
    it use \texttt{Bootstrapping} that are techniques that refresh this error.

    Even slower!!! Bottleneck.

\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Schemes}

    Many schemes. \textbf{Warning}: Many acronyms!!!

    Popular schemes by types:
    \begin{itemize}\vspace{-0.2cm}
        \item Operations on integers: \textbf{BFV} and BGV.\vspace{-0.2cm}
        \item Operations on real numbers: CKKS.\vspace{-0.2cm}
        \item Operations on Boolean gates: FHEW and THFHE.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Paper}: BFV.

    \textbf{''Upgrades''}:
\begin{itemize}\vspace{-0.2cm}
    \item Residue Number System (RNS) (stay with 64bits arithmetic's).        Represent the bigger input as the residues of $k$ relative primes.
        Then we operate pair-wise.
 \vspace{-0.2cm}
   \item SIMD arithmetic (batching).
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{BFV}

Works in a Polynomial Ring domain.

\textbf{Ring}: a set with addition, subtraction and multiplication. (and other property's, commutative, associative, etc).

    This operations of elements in a ring return elements in the ring $\rightarrow$  \textbf{modular arithmetics}.

\textbf{Parameters}: are application-specific and desire security.

\begin{itemize}
    \item $\lambda$ security level. $\sim$ $2^\lambda$ operation to decrypt with prob 1.
    \item $N$: the degree of the Polynomials ($N$-1).
    \item $q$ and $t$: the mod of the coefficients.
    \item $k$: size of the set of the RNS technique.
\end{itemize}


\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{BFV Primitives}

    Basic Primitives (simplified):
\begin{itemize}
    \item ParamGen($\lambda$)$\rightarrow$ Params.
    \item KeyGen(Params) $\rightarrow$ SK, PK, EvalK (each is a tuple of two polynomials)
   \item Encrypt(PK, m) $\rightarrow$ c (tuple of two polynomials)
    \item Decrypt(SK, c) $\rightarrow$ m
    \item EvalAdd(c$_1$, c$_2$) $\rightarrow$ c$_3$ (tuple of two polynomials)
    \item EvalMult(c$_1$, c$_2$) $\rightarrow$ c$_{mul}$ (tuple of three polynomials)
    \item Relinerize(c$_{mul}$, EvalK) $\rightarrow$ c$_{mul}$' (tuple of two polynomials)
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Bootstrapping tradeoff}

    Approach 1: \textbf{No Bootstrapping}

    Know how many operations are needed (depth level)

    Bigger scheme parameters $\approx$ bigger noise budget $\approx$ slower computation.

    Approach 2: \textbf{Bootstrapping}

    Use Bootstrapping us needed.

    Approach 3: \textbf{Client-aided}

    Use the client to unencrypt an encrypt again (refresh the noise).
\end{frame}



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% combinarla con la de los parametros.
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Parameters}

The parameters depends in the security level needed and amount of operations that will made.


Some usual parameters to get the sense of what we are doing:

$N$ = 8192, 16384, 32768 $\rightarrow$ bigger $N$ $\approx$ bigger noise budget but bigger ciphertex and heavier computation.

    $q$ = $2^{218}$,   $2^{438}$,  $2^{881}$ $\rightarrow$ bigger $q$ $\approx$ bigger noise budget but bigger ciphertex and heavier computation.

    $t$  << $q$. $\rightarrow$ smaller $t$ $\approx$ bigger noise budget but less precision.

% que significa q/t


\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% combinarla con la de los parametros.
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Operations}

    \textbf{Keys generations}: Sample 3 polynomials. Then two polynomial multiplication, Two additions and two modulus.

    \textbf{Encryption}: Sample 3 polynomials. Then two polynomial multiplication, one scalar multiplication, three additions and two modulus.

    \textbf{Decryption}: similar to Encryption.

    \textbf{Multiplication + Relinerize}: Six polynomial multiplications, three additions and five modulus.

   Multiplications make the noise grow a lot.


\end{frame}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Recap}

    \textbf{Remember!} All things are high degree polynomials with huge coefficient.


Each homomorphic operation is $10^3 \sim 10^6$ times slower than unencrypted.
\pause

Large footprint in memory.
An encrypted date can occupy $10^5$ more space.

\pause
    The schemes are iterative, operating many time with each data specially Bootstrapping (CHOCO don't use it).

   \item New schemes.
   \item New upgrades in the schemes (like RNS).
   \item New methods of Bootstrapping.
   \item Algorithms implementations, like packed ones (concatenate multiple plaintexts).
   \item Accelerating the polynomial multiplication:
       For these they use Number Theoretic Transform (NTT), a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) over a ring.
   \item Hardware Acceleration (GPUs, FPGA, specific designs).
\end{itemize}

    \textbf{Linearity problem}: Approximate with polynomial expansions.

\frametitle{New approach}

CHOCO: \textbf{C}lient-aided \textbf{H}E for \textbf{O}paque \textbf{C}ompute \textbf{O}ffloading.

    Is a \textbf{client-aided} HE: client refresh noise when is needed.

    Client also do non-linear operations, like activation functions in Neural Netwroks (NN)

     CHOCO accelerates the client side, specially encryption and decryption.

% para que y cuando se utiliza el rotacional redundancy

\begin{itemize}\itemsep-0.7em
        \item New algorithm: rotational redundancy $\rightarrow$ reduces computation costs.
    \item Reduces ciphertext size $\rightarrow$ reducing the cost of communication.
    \item Reduction of parameters values $\rightarrow$ reduces computation and communication costs.
    \item Hardware acceleration for client: CHOCO-TACO.

\section{Research}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Motivation}
The most clear example: DNN inference.
% they use a lot, and things like rotational seems to be boosted.

    \textbf{Before}: No client intermediate communication $\rightarrow$ adapt networks architecture and approximations of non-linear operations.

    \textbf{Problems}: Fast noise accumulation, large HE parameters, big ciphertext (more costly to process and communication)

CHOCO:
\begin{itemize}
    \vspace{-0.2cm}  \item Client-aided $\rightarrow$ offload linear convolution and fully-connected layers to HE server.
    \vspace{-0.2cm}\item Send intermediate results to the client to perform non-linear operations and refresh noise.
    \vspace{-0.2cm}\item Supports unmodified networks with arbitrary activation functions.
\end{itemize}

Larger client cost!
CHOCO minimize this cost (with also CHOCO-TACO).

    Idea: Minimize arithmetic Depth % y esto?

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Lower Noise Growth.
        \item Lower Parameters Selections.
        \item Lower Ciphertext Size.

    Less computation, memory demmands and commuinication.

\frametitle{Rotational Redundancy}

Packed HE algorithms $\rightarrow$  aligned vectors to operate in the desire way.

    Rearrange encrypted vectors $\rightarrow$ rotations and multiplications  $\rightarrow$ Noise grows a lot!

%Convolutions use a lot of rotations. Explica como lo usaron...
New algorithm! Rotational Redundancy $\rightarrow$ lower arithmetic depth $\rightarrow$ less noise.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Rotational Redundancy - CHOCO}
Exploits the fact that the client  always decrypt, unpack, repack and encrypt.

So client discard redundant data adds new values for the next operation.

Typically the redundancy is a small fraction of the total vector size.

Convolution requieres windowed rotation within each channel.

CHOCO packs each channel of an image with sufficient redundancy to keep
values aligned through the encrypted convolution.

CHOCO stacks the redundan channel vector into evenly-spaced, power-of-two-sized slots in the final ciphertext vector.

All elements can be properly aligned for convolution.

50\% reduction of ciphertext size compared to SEALS with same N=8192.

One less  RNS entry.

    Encryption has two phases:

    - From an integer m to plaintext M $\rightarrow$ Easy, one way: binary representation as Polynomial coefficient.

    - From plaintext to ciphertext using $PK = (PK_1, PK_2)$:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sample a polynomial $u$ from $\mathcal{R}_2$.
        \item Sample polynomial errors $e_1$ and $e_2$ form a Gaussian distribution.
        \item Calculate scaling factor $\triangle = \lfloor q/t\rfloor $
        \item Encryption of plaintext M is $C=(C_1, C_2)$
    \end{itemize}
    %
    \begin{align}
        &C_1 = [PK_1 * u + e_1 + \triangle M ]_q\nonumber \\

    \vspace{-0.15cm}

    \textbf{Problem}: If we keep multiplying, the number of Polynomials will grow and will be needed
    the squared of the SK.

    \textbf{Relinerize}:
    $EvalK = (-PK_1+SK^2, PK_2)$

    $C_{mul} = (C_a, C_b, C_c)\approx ([C_a+EvalK_1*C_c]_q, [C_b+EvalK_2*C_c]_q)$

    \textbf{Other problem}: high noise growth: we are multiplying the errors of the two ciphertexts, the result error
    grows a lot!
    \vspace{-0.1cm}

    \textbf{Solution}: \vspace{-0.3cm}
    \begin{itemize} \vspace{-0.2cm}
